# RiceSeedDevelopment
My 4th year research

This is to predict novel candidates in rice grain development using network approach. Then to extract sub network of rice seed development and identify associated sub modules and hubs with functional annotations. 

An ensemble of network based algorithms are used here. Those are majority vote, hishigaki, network propagation and functional flow. Community detection is done using louvain algorithm.
