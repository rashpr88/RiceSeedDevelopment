# RiceSeedDevelopment
In my fourth-year research project, I focused on predicting novel candidates involved in rice grain development using a network-based approach. The goal was to extract a subnetwork specifically related to rice seed development and identify associated submodules and hubs with functional annotations.

To achieve this, I employed an ensemble of network-based algorithms, including majority vote, Hishigaki, network propagation, and functional flow. Additionally, community detection was performed using the Louvain algorithm to identify distinct groups within the network.

The overall objective of the research was to gain insights into the complex regulatory mechanisms underlying rice grain development by leveraging network analysis techniques and identifying key players and functional modules within the seed development network.
