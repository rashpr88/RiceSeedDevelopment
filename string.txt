Uses inorganic phosphate (PPi) as phosphoryl donor instead of ATP like common ATP-dependent phosphofructokinases (ATP-PFKs), which renders the reaction reversible, and can thus function both in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis            Q0DD75                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 NaN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          NaN
